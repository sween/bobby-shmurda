## Overview

**Bobby Shmurda**, the github repository that raises the bar for "hello world" for the next generation of *developers*.  We are in a world where the understanding of a programming language cannot be understood by a simple return of io to your screen or browser or phone or internet of thing output device.  Sooner or later, if you sleep with a language long enough, you are going to have to fuck with time.

Here you will find a collection of examples of various programming languages that marshall time as an introduction.  

_**The Bobby Shmurda example will specifically return a string value of what time it was a week ago, enumerated from the current date and time for the target programming langauge.**_

Each programming language is represented in a single root folder of the repository.  The example with the most github stars, is represented in the root of the directory and highlighted in the readme for that directory.  The example provided for representation should adhere to the following ground rules as described below.


### AboutAWeekAgo
Committers will be crafting a runnable example in their programming language of choice.  
#### Syntax
The premise being the runnable component of the method, routine, or whatever be represented in the preferred syntax for that programming language.  For example, if I were to be committing an example for LISP, the method name would be represented like the following:

    ;;; BobbyShmurda.lsp

	;;; =========== BOBBY SHMURDA SIMULATION ============== ;;;

    ;;; This function returns the string value of a date that was about a week ago 

    (DEFUN ABOUTAWEEKAGO ()
    ;;; LISPY CODE
    "Weekday Month DayofMonth, Year" // Ex. Tuesday September 11, 2001
    ) 

#### The Return Value
Yeah, look above.  This is how we are going to roll for now, but the rules may change.  Note Bobby's operative word of "About", so let's start with no representation of precision of hour/minute/second and go with this single rule:

If you were going to the club, and somebody said they were going to pick you up "In About 2 Hours" and then showed up in like 3 hours would you be pissed?  Is 8 days a week? This is the accuracy we are expecting out of the example and the internet will judge you anyway so WTF.

Return type is a string with a value that must match:

    "Weekday Month DayofMonth, Year" // Ex. Tuesday September 11, 2001
#### Can I use a C3PO?
Yeah, if you want to use a commercial third party off the shelf to accomplish this task then go right the hell ahead.  However, the

#### Links and Email

An email <example@example.com> link.

Simple inline link <http://chenluois.com>, another inline link [Smaller](http://25.io/smaller/), one more inline link with title [Resize](http://resizesafari.com "a Safari extension").

A [reference style][id] link. Input id, then anywhere in the doc, define the link with corresponding id:

[id]: http://25.io/mou/ "Markdown editor on Mac OS X"

Titles ( or called tool tips ) in the links are optional.

#### Images

An inline image ![Smaller icon](http://25.io/smaller/favicon.ico "Title here"), title is optional.

A ![Resize icon][2] reference style image.

[2]: http://resizesafari.com/favicon.ico "Title"

#### Inline code and Block code

Inline code are surround by `backtick` key. To create a block code:

	Indent each line by at least 1 tab, or 4 spaces.
    var Mou = exactlyTheAppIwant; 

####  Ordered Lists




### Extra Syntax

#### Footnotes

Footnotes work mostly like reference-style links. A footnote is made of two things: a marker in the text that will become a superscript number; a footnote definition that will be placed in a list of footnotes at the end of the document. A footnote looks like this:

That's some text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And that's the footnote.


#### Strikethrough

Wrap with 2 tilde characters:

~~Strikethrough~~



### FAQ

Unordered list are created using "*" + Space:

* Unordered list item
* Unordered list item
* Unordered list item
